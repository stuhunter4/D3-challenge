## D3-challenge
Data visualization challenge utilizing information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System; namely a data set based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates.  This data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state.  MOE stands for "margin of error."  The core task here is to create a "D3 Dabbler": a scatter plot that represents each state with  abberviations inside circle elements.  This graphic is coded in the app.js file, pulling data from data.csv using the d3.csv function.
